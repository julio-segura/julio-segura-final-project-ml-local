# CO2 Emission Prediction in Rwanda: Data Science Bootcamp Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the 4Geeks Data Science Bootcamp. The project focuses on predicting the levels of CO2 emissions in Rwanda using machine learning algorithms. The application is built using Python and Streamlit and aims to provide insights into the factors affecting CO2 levels, as well as future projections.

Features:
- Data Upload: Ability to upload custom datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand the data and the factors affecting CO2 levels.
- Prediction: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict future CO2 levels based on various features.
- Model Evaluation: Displays metrics to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
- Interactive Maps: Geospatial representation of CO2 levels across different regions in Rwanda.
